 * All methods should return a NotFound response code if a search using a Primary Key does not find any results.
 * 
 * Otherwise, the method should return an empty collection of the resource indicated in the root directory of the request.
 * 
 * All methods with a name and id parameter can use either. 
 * 
 * Searches by name should use the first queried element that contains the entire string (for example, "spa" returns "spaghetti" while "spaghettio" returns nothing).
 * 
 * Requests with a Name AND ID argument should query the database using the ID. If no match is found, the query should again be performed using the name.
